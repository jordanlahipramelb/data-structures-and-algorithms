/** FIRST IN, FIRST OUT (FIFO)
 * Example: standing in line for a ticket
 * 
 * Like a List, Except‚Ä¶
    - Items are only added to a queue by enqueueing them at the back
    - Items are only removed from a queue by dequeueing them at the front
    - Thus, newer items are near back of queue, older items are near front
    - FIFO for ‚ÄúFirst-in, first-out‚Äù
* Typical methods
enqueue(item)
- Add to end
dequeue()
- Remove & return first item
peek()
- Return first item, but don‚Äôt remove
isEmpty()
- Are there items in the queue?

Linked List: yes, both enqueue & dequeue are O(1) (head is top)
Doubly Linked List: yes, both enqueue & dequeue are O(1)
